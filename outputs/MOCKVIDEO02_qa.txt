Q1: what if I told you that about 70% of candidates fail their technical?
A1: interviews and guess what python

Q2: interviews and guess what python questions are the biggest challenge so if you're someone who's going to attend?
A2: a python interview soon but don't know

Q3: what sort of questions you might face then you've landed at the right place python is undoubtedly one of the most?
A3: popular programming languages today it's a Top Choice for both season developers and beginners Python's flexibility and wide range of users makes it an invaluable tool in the software development field experts predict that

Q4: question number one what is the difference between a module and a package in this particular answer there?
A4: are three pointers that are necessary a

Q5: are three pointers that are necessary a module is a single file or multiple files containing python code this code?
A5: can Define functions classes and

Q6: can Define functions classes and variables typically a module is a python file ending with a py extension modules?
A6: help organize and reuse code by grouping related code together for example you

Q7: can have a module Fu that contains all the mathematical functions you need for a project making your code cleaner and?
A7: more manageable now as for packages a package on the other hand is a collection of modules organized in a directory hierarchy packages allow for a structured organization of related modules making it easier to manage large

Q8: related modules together which helps avoid module name collisions and organize code in a scalable manner so to?
A8: sum it up modules are single files with python code perfect for grouping related functions classes and variables packages

Q9: are directories of modules organized in a way that scales well for larger projects both are essential for writing?
A9: clean organized and reusable python code moving on to question number two is python a compile language or an interpreted language python is primarily uninterpreted language this means that python code is executed line by line by

A10: compiled into bite code and what is bite

Q11: compiled into bite code and what is bite code bite code is an intermediate low-level representation of your code?
A11: that is more abstract than machine code but still not human readable once the source code is compiled into bite code this bite code is executed by the python interpretor the interpretor reads and executes the bite code line by line

Q12: three what are the benefits of using Python language as a tool in the present scenario now this question is not asked?
A12: regularly but if you're targeting top tier companies then you should probably take a look at this question that fan companies might ask you during the interview process so first up Simplicity Python's easy to read and write syntax

A97: python modules which are having circular

Q98: python modules which are having circular references to other objects or objects that are reference from the global name?
A98: spaces the memory is not always deallocated or freed it is not possible to deallocate Those portions of memory that are reserved by the ca library on exit because of having its own efficient cleanup mechanism python will try to

Q99: is a set known as unordered is it mutable or immutable make sure you have a solid understanding of this concept a?
A99: set is called unordered because the items in a set don't have specific order or sequence like a list does it's more like a collection of items and you can't access them by their position sets in

Q100: Python are mutable which means you can add or remove items from a set after it's created however the items within?
A100: the set are themselves immutable meaning they cannot be changed you can add or remove elements from a set but you can't modify the elements themselves once they
