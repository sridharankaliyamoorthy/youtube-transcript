what if I told you that about 70% of
candidates fail their technical
interviews and guess what python
questions are the biggest challenge so
if you're someone who's going to attend
a python interview soon but don't know
what sort of questions you might face
then you've landed at the right place
python is undoubtedly one of the most
popular programming languages today it's
a Top Choice for both season developers
and beginners Python's flexibility and
wide range of users makes it an
invaluable tool in the software
development field experts predict that
it will continue to be a dominant player
in the industry for years to come to
help you prepare we've compiled some
questions based on real life interviews
that candidates have faced but before we
begin with our video make sure to
subscribe to our YouTube channel and hit
the Bell icon so you don't miss any
updates that will be coming from us so
let's start with our python interview
questions we'll start off with the
beginner level interview questions so so
question number one what is the
difference between a module and a
package in this particular answer there
are three pointers that are necessary a
module is a single file or multiple
files containing python code this code
can Define functions classes and
variables typically a module is a python
file ending with a py extension modules
help organize and reuse code by grouping
related code together for example you
can have a module Fu that contains all
the mathematical functions you need for
a project making your code cleaner and
more manageable now as for packages a
package on the other hand is a
collection of modules organized in a
directory hierarchy packages allow for a
structured organization of related
modules making it easier to manage large
code bases a package is essentially a
directory hierarchy that contains a
special file named init.py this file can
be empty or can execute initialization
code for the
package packages provide a way to group
related modules together which helps
avoid module name collisions and
organize code in a scalable manner so to
sum it up modules are single files with
python code perfect for grouping related
functions classes and variables packages
are directories of modules organized in
a way that scales well for larger
projects both are essential for writing
clean organized and reusable python code
moving on to question number two is
python a compile language or an
interpreted language python is primarily
uninterpreted language this means that
python code is executed line by line by
an interpretor at runtime rather than
being compiled into machine code
beforehand like in compile languages
such as C or
C++ however python is also part
partially compiled when you run a Python
program the source code is first
compiled into bite code and what is bite
code bite code is an intermediate
low-level representation of your code
that is more abstract than machine code
but still not human readable once the
source code is compiled into bite code
this bite code is executed by the python
interpretor the interpretor reads and
executes the bite code line by line
converting it into machine codee that
your computer processor can understand
and execute next up question number
three what are the benefits of using
Python language as a tool in the present
scenario now this question is not asked
regularly but if you're targeting top
tier companies then you should probably
take a look at this question that fan
companies might ask you during the
interview process so first up Simplicity
Python's easy to read and write syntax
makes it accessible for beginners and
allows experien developers to write
efficient error-free code quickly then
we have versatility python is used in
various Fields like web development data
analysis AI machine learning and
automation making it highly versatile
tool then we'll talk about the libraries
and Frameworks python has a rich
ecosystem of libraries and Frameworks
such as Jango pandas and tensor flow
which accelerate development and
implementation next will talk about the
strong Community Support a large active
Community provides extensive
documentation tutorials and forums
ensuring continuous learning and support
then we'll talk about portability python
is a platform independent running
seamlessly on Windows Mac OS and Linux
which simplifies development and
deployment across different environments
next we'll talk about the development
speed its Simplicity and Powerful life
liaries enabled rapid prototyping and
quick iteration reducing time to Market
and enhancing
adaptability then we'll talk about
Dynamic typing Python's Dynamic typing
makes coding flexible and faster
although it requires careful management
to avoid type related errors then lastly
we'll talk about open source Python's
opsource nature means it's free to use
modify and distribute with ongoing
improvements driven by a collaborative
Community moving on to question number
four what are Global protected and
private attributes in Python now this is
one of the most important questions
asked by the interviewers so Global
variables are public variables defined
in the global scope to use a global
variable inside a function the global
keyword is required protected attributes
are marked with a single
underscore while they can still be
access and modified from outside the
class responsible developers should
avoid doing so private attributes are
marked with a double underscore these
cannot be accessed or modified directly
from outside the class and any such
attempt will result in an attribute
error is python case sensitive yes
python is a case sensitive language this
means that the language distinguishes
between uppercase and lowercase
characters in identifiers as you can see
the example on the screen for example
the variables name ver ver with a
capital V and V R would be considered
three distinct variables in Python what
is pandas this is a very basic question
the interviewers may not ask this but
you should know about this Library so
pandas is an open-source python Library
which supports data structures for
databased operations associated with
data analyzing and data manipulations p
with its Rich sets of features fits in
every role of data operation whether it
be related to implementing different
algorithms or solving complex business
problems pandas helps to deal with a
number of files in performing certain
operations on the data stored by files
next up question number seven how is
exceptional handling done in Python well
in Python the main keywords for handling
exceptions are try accept and finally
the try block contains the code that is
monitored for errors if an error occurs
the except block is executed to handle
the exception the finally block has the
unique feature of executing code after
the tri block regardless of whether an
error occurred or not it is typically
used for cleanup activities of objects
or variables ensuring that necessary
cleanup is performed in all
circumstances moving to question number
eight what is the difference between for
Loop Loop and while loop in Python while
this might seem like a niche topic it's
a favorite among interviewers so having
a solid grasp on it can give you a
Competitive Edge the for Loop is
commonly used to iterate through
elements of various collections such as
lists tles sets and dictionaries
developers use the for Loop when they
have both straight and ending conditions
on the other hand the Y Loop is standard
looping construct used in many
programming languages programmers use a
while loop in Python when they have only
the ending condition to
specify moving on to question number
nine is indentation required in Python
yes indentation is required in Python
because the python interpretor uses
indentation to determine which
statements belong to a specific block of
code while indentation improves code
readability in all programming languages
it is especially crucial in python as it
defines the structure and flow of the
code then moving on to question number
10 what is the use of Self in Python
self is used to represent an instance of
the class with this keyword you can
access the attributes and methods of the
class in Python finding the attributes
with the provided arguments although
commonly used in various places self is
often mistaken for a keyword unlike in
C++ self is not a keyword in Python next
up we're going to talk about python
interview questions for intermediate
question number 11 how does python
manage memory explain the role of
reference counting and garbage
collection expect this question to be a
major part of your interview it's
fundamental to many roles and gives
interviewers insight into your
analytical skills and logical thinking
python uses reference counting to track
object references and automatically
delocated objects with zero references
it also has a garbage collector to
handle cyclic references moving on to
question number 12 does python support
multiple inheritance well unlike Java
python supports multiple inheritance
this means that a class can be derived
from more than one parent class question
number 13 how is memory management done
in Python this is one of those questions
that separates the good candidates from
the great ones especially when
interviewing with top tier tech
companies python manages memory using a
private Heap space where all objects and
data structures are stored programmers
cannot directly access this private Heap
it is managed by the python interpretor
additionally python has a built-in
garbage collector that automatically
recycles unused memory freeing it up and
making it available for future use then
moving on to question number 14 how to
delete a file using python we can delete
a file using python by the following
approaches the first is your os. remove
and the second is os. unlink now next up
question number 15 which sorting
technique is used by sort and sorted
functions of python so python uses the
Tim sort algorithm for sorting which
means stable sorting method with a worst
case complexity of o n log n Tim sord is
a hybrid algorithm derived from merge
sword and insertion sword designed to
perform efficiently on various types of
real world data question number 16
differentiate between list and tle this
is a go-to question for interviewers to
assess your depth of understanding and
knowledge list are defined using square
brackets while tles use parentheses list
are mutable so so we can modify them we
can change their elements add or remove
elements in contrast tles are immutable
so we cannot change their elements once
they are created so to sum it up lists
are mutable consume more memory and have
slower insertion deletion and iteration
speed due to Dynamic allocation whereas
stles are immutable more memory
efficient and offer faster iteration but
do not support insertion and deletion
question number number 17 what is
slicing in python python slicing is an
operation used to extract a portion of a
string or a list by specifying the start
end and step you can determine the exact
segment to extract slicing a list
results in a new list created from the
specified portion of the original list
the Syntax for slicing in Python is
sequence start stop and step where start
index is where the slice Begins the
element at this index is included in the
slice if omitted it defaults to the
beginning of the sequence then we have
stop stop is the index where the slice
ends the element at this index is not
included in the slice if omitted it
defaults to end of the sequence then we
have step this is the interval between
elements in the slice if omitted it
defaults to one meaning every element
between start and stop is in included
this slicing syntax allows you to
extract a subsequence from a given
sequence such as list Tuple or string
question number 18 how is
multi-threading achieved in Python
multi-threading in Python is achieved
using the threading module which enables
the concurrent execution of multiple
threads within a single process each
thread can run its own code and perform
tasks
simultaneously however due to Python's
Global inter operator lock only one
thread can execute python bite code at a
time per process which limits the
performance benefits for CPU bound tasks
despite this multi- threading is
effective for input output bound tasks
such as file operations or network
communication where the global
interpretor locks impact is minimal next
up question number 19 which is faster
python list or numpy arrays you won't
encounter this question in every
interview but it's a common challenge in
technical interviews so make sure you're
prepared in general numpy Aras are
faster than python list for numerical
computations and operations involving
large data sets this is because numai
array are implemented in C and optimized
for performance while python list are
more flexible but slower due to their
Dynamic nature and lack of optimization
for numerical computations on the other
hand it's essential to note that there
are scenarios where python lists may be
more suitable such as when dealing with
heterogenous data types or when
flexibility is more critical than
performance ultimately the choice
between Python list and numpy array
depends on the specific requirements of
the task at hand moving on to question
number 20 explain inheritance in Python
while not every interview will include
this question it's often used to test
your ability inheritance in Python
allows the class called the child class
or subass to inherit attributes and
methods from another class called the
parent class or super class without the
need to rewrite them through inheritance
the child class can reuse the code of
the parent class extend its
functionality or override its methods
with specialized
implementation this promotes code
reusability modularity and creation of
hierarchy of related classes making it
easier to manage and maintain complex
software systems then question number 21
how are classes created in Python in
Python classes are created using the
class keyword followed by the class name
and a column inside the class methods
and attributes are defined here's a
basic example this code defines a class
my class with a shared class attribute
an instance attribute set during object
creation and a method that returns a
message containing the instance
attribute it then demonstrates creating
an instance and accessing these
attributes and Method question number 22
write a program to produce Fibonacci
series in Python this is a classic
question that's frequently Asked in
interviews it's fundamental yet powerful
as it tests your understanding of loops
and recursion mastering the Fibonacci
series not only helps you in interviews
but also strengthens your problem
solving skills which are crucial for any
programming role the Fibonacci series or
Fibonacci sequence is a sequence of
numbers where each number is the sum of
two preceding ones it usually starts
with zero and one this program defines a
function Fibonacci that generates the
first end terms of the Fibonacci series
it starts with a list containing the
first two Fibonacci numbers 0o and 1 and
then continues to append the sum of the
last two numbers in the list until it
reaches the desired length finally it
prints the Fibonacci series with the
specified number of terms moving to
question number 23 what is the
difference between shallow copy and deep
copy in Python let's take a look at the
key differences according to Shared
references in a shallow copy references
to objects are shared between the
original and the copy in in a deep copy
all objects are fully copied so no
references are shared according to
Performance shallow copying is faster
and uses less memory because it doesn't
copy objects themselves only the
references deep copying is slower and
uses more memory because it duplicates
everything moving to question number 24
what is the process of compilation and
linking in Python the process of
compilation in Python involves
converting the source code written by
the programmer into a form that can be
executed by the python interpretor in
Python the process of linking is not
explicit and complex in compiled
languages like C or C++ however it
involves several steps related to the
import and usage of modules and packages
next question number 25 what is break
continue and pass in Python this is also
a common question you should prepare for
break the break statement immediately
ends the loop and transfers control to
the first statement following the Loop's
body continue the continue statement
ends the current iteration of the loop
skips the remaining code in this
iteration and proceeds with the next
iteration of the loop then pass the pass
keyword in Python is used to fill empty
blocks of code it acts as a placeholder
similar to an empty statement in
languages like Java C++ and JavaScript
question number 26 what is
p8 p8 is the python enhancement proposal
that provides guidelines and best
practices on how to write python code it
is essentially the style guide for
python code helping developers write
code that is readable and consistent by
following p8 developers ensure their
code is readable maintainable and
consistent with the broader python
Community which facilitates
collaboration and reduces
misunderstandings question number 27
what is an expression an expression in
Python and in programming in general is
a combination of values variables
operators and calls to function that the
language interpretor evaluates to
produce another value expressions are
fundamental building blocks in python as
they represent computations moving to
question number 28 what is double equals
in Python in Python double equals is the
equality operator it is used to compare
two values to determine if they are
equal if the values on the either side
of the double operator are equal the
expression evaluates to True otherwise
it evaluates to false moving to question
number 29 what is Type conversion in
Python type conversion in Python refers
to the process of converting a value
from one data type to another this can
be necessary when you need to perform
operations on data that require it to be
in a specific format or type some common
type conversion functions are mentioned
as below int converts a value to an
integer float converts a value to a
float s Str converts a value to a string
list converts a value to a list tle
converts a value to a tuple set converts
a value to a set dict converts a
sequence of key values into a dictionary
moving to our last question of this
segment question number 30 name some
commonly used build-in modules in Python
some of the commonly used built-in
modules are os Sy math random data time
and Json now let's move ahead with our
Advanced python interview questions our
first question question number 31 what
is the difference between X range and
range in functions this is also one of
the most common questions asked in
Python range and X range functions are
used to iterate a specific number of
times in for Loops the range function
returns a list of numbers the xrange
function Returns the generator object
that can display only numbers by looping
it displays only a particular range on
demand and thus it is known as lazy
evaluation the xrange function is not
found in Python 3 the range function
function works like xrange in Python 2
question number 32 what is the zip
function zip function returns a zip
object that Maps multiple containers
identical indexes it accepts an iterable
transforms it into an iterator and
Aggregates the elements depending on
iterables past furthermore it returns an
iterator of tles moving to question
number 33 what is Jango architecture one
of the important p Via questions Jango
is a highlevel web framework built in
Python that allows rapid development of
maintainable and secure websites its
architecture consists of model where the
data is managed and stored in the
backend then template where the data is
stored in the front end of the web page
then view where functions accepts the
web request and delivers the web
responses next question number 34 what
is inher itance and python you will
frequently encounter this question in
interviews inheritance allows a class to
get all members of another class the
members can be methods attributes or
both with reusability inheritance stream
lines and applications development and
maintainance there are four types of
inheritance in Python there are single
inheritance multi-level inheritance
hierarchial inheritance and multiple
inheritance moving to question number 35
Define star args and star star quarks in
Python in Python star args allows a
function to accept n number of
positional arguments also known as
non-keyword arguments and variable
length argument list whereas star star
quars serves as a special syntax that
allows us to pass a variable length of
keyword arguments to the function
question number 36 do runtime errors
exist in in Python explain with an
example yes runtime errors are found in
Python for example when you were duck
typing and things appear like a duck it
is regarded as a duck although it is
merely a stamp or flag in this case the
code has a runtime error another example
is the print hacker IO that shows the
runtime error due to the missing
parentheses in
print moving on to question number 37
what are doc strings in Python one of
the most important question doc strings
or documentation strings are multi-line
strings used to document a specific code
segment doc strings usually come within
triple quotes and should ideally
describe what a function or method does
although they are not comments doc
strings sometimes serve the purpose of
comments since they are not assigned to
any
variable now moving to question number
38 how can you capit capitalize the
first letter of a string in Python in
Python you can use the capitalize method
to capitalize the first letter of a
string however if a string already
consists of a capital letter at the
beginning it will return to the original
string moving on to question number 39
what are generators in Python generators
are most important python functions that
return an iterable collection of items
one at a time in an organized manner
generally generators are used to create
iterators with a different approach they
use of yield keyword rather than return
to return a generator object moving to
question number 40 how to write commands
in Python it's very likely that you'll
face this question in your interview so
in Python commands start with a hash
character however sometimes you can also
write commands using doc strings strings
enclosed within triple
unlike C++ python does not support
multi-line commands here's how a command
is written in Python line one of command
line two of command moving to question
number 41 what is g g or the global
interpreter lock is a mutex used to
limit access to python objects it
synchronizes threads and prevents them
from running at the same time moving to
question number 42 is D Jango better
than flask well D Jango is better suited
for large complex applications with many
built-in features while flask is better
for small to medium projects requiring
more flexibility and control the choice
depends on your specific needs and
project requirements question number 43
what is flask explain its benefits flask
is a lightweight and flexible web
framework for python that provides the
essential tools to build web
applications making it easy to get
started and scaled as needed then we
have Simplicity and minimalism flask is
easy to learn and use making it ideal
for beginners and quick development of
small to mediumsized
Applications then flexibility it
provides complete control over
application components and structure
allowing High customization to meet
specific needs then modular and
extensible flask modular design lets you
add only the components you need with
many third-party extensions available
for added
functionality then wide adoption and
Community Support a large active
Community offers extensive tutorials
extensions and support making it easier
to find Solutions and best
practices next question number 44 what
is PIP you won't find this question in
every interview but it's a regular
feature in technical interviews to test
your understanding pip is an acronym for
python installer package which provides
a seamless interface to install various
python modules it is a command line tool
that can search for packages over the
internet and install them without any
user interaction moving to question
number 45 how can you ensure that your
python code is compatible with python 2
and Python 3 to write code that is
compatible with with both python 2 and 3
you can use the future module to import
python 3.x Behavior into python 2.x code
use a compatibility Library like six or
future to bridge differences follow best
practices for writing compatible code
such as using print as a function using
absolute import to handle Imports using
uni code literals for string handling
and being cautious with integer division
run two to three to automatically
convert python 2 code to Python 3 next
question number 46 what is the
difference between modulus operator
division operator and floor division
operator the modulus operator is the
modulo operator which Returns the
remainder of a division for instance
five modulus 2 would return one the
division operator performs floating
Point Division and returns of float for
example 5 division 2 would return 2.5
the floor division divion operator
performs division but rounds down the
result to the nearest whole number so
five floor division two would return two
moving to question number 47 why doesn't
python deallocate all memory upon exit
whenever python exits especially those
python modules which are having circular
references to other objects or objects
that are reference from the global name
spaces the memory is not always
deallocated or freed it is not possible
to deallocate Those portions of memory
that are reserved by the ca library on
exit because of having its own efficient
cleanup mechanism python will try to
deallocate every
object moving to question number 48 why
is a set known as unordered is it
mutable or immutable make sure you have
a solid understanding of this concept a
set is called unordered because the
items in a set don't have specific order
or sequence like a list does it's more
like a collection of items and you can't
access them by their position sets in
Python are mutable which means you can
add or remove items from a set after
it's created however the items within
the set are themselves immutable meaning
they cannot be changed you can add or
remove elements from a set but you can't
modify the elements themselves once they
are in the set moving to question number
49 what is the difference between data
frames and series a series is a
one-dimensional array like object in
pandas that can hold any data type while
a data frame is a two-dimensional table
like structure with potentially
heterogeneously typed columns you can
think of a data frame as a collection of
series objects that share the same index
moving to our last question question
number 50 what does Len do the Len
function is used to determine the length
of various data types such as strings
list errors Etc with that we conclude
