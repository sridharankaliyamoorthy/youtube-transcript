what sort of questions you might face then you've landed at the right place python is undoubtedly one of the most?
question number one what is the difference between a module and a package in this particular answer there?
are three pointers that are necessary a module is a single file or multiple files containing python code this code?
can Define functions classes and variables typically a module is a python file ending with a py extension modules?
can have a module Fu that contains all the mathematical functions you need for a project making your code cleaner and?
related modules together which helps avoid module name collisions and organize code in a scalable manner so to?
are directories of modules organized in a way that scales well for larger projects both are essential for writing?

Tim sort algorithm for sorting which means stable sorting method with a worst case complexity of o n log n Tim sord is?
is a go-to question for interviewers to assess your depth of understanding and knowledge list are defined using square?
are mutable so so we can modify them we?
can change their elements add or remove elements in contrast tles are immutable so we cannot change their elements once?
are mutable consume more memory and have slower insertion deletion and iteration speed due to Dynamic allocation whereas?
do not support insertion and deletion?
question number number 17 what is slicing in python python slicing is an operation used to extract a portion of a?
sequence start stop and step where start?
index is where the slice Begins the element at this index is included in the slice if omitted it defaults to the?
stop stop is the index where the slice ends the element at this index is not included in the slice if omitted it?
have step this is the interval between elements in the slice if omitted it defaults to one meaning every element?
question number 18 how is multi-threading achieved in Python multi-threading in Python is achieved?
using the threading module which enables the concurrent execution of multiple threads within a single process each?
time per process which limits the performance benefits for CPU bound tasks despite this multi- threading is?
communication where the global interpretor locks impact is minimal next?
up question number 19 which is faster python list or numpy arrays you won't encounter this question in every?
are scenarios where python lists may be?
more suitable such as when dealing with?
heterogenous data types or when flexibility is more critical than performance ultimately the choice?
how are classes created in Python in Python classes are created using the class keyword followed by the class name?
solving skills which are crucial for any programming role the Fibonacci series or Fibonacci sequence is a sequence of?
numbers where each number is the sum of two preceding ones it usually starts with zero and one this program defines a?
question number 23 what is the difference between shallow copy and deep copy in Python let's take a look at the?
what is the process of compilation and linking in Python the process of compilation in Python involves?
next question number 25 what is break continue and pass in Python this is also a common question you should prepare for?
question number 26 what is p8 p8 is the python enhancement proposal that provides guidelines and best?
practices on how to write python code it?
is essentially the style guide for python code helping developers write code that is readable and consistent by?
Community which facilitates collaboration and reduces misunderstandings question number 27?
what is an expression an expression in Python and in programming in general is a combination of values variables?
question number 28 what is double equals in Python in Python double equals is the equality operator it is used to compare?
number 29 what is Type conversion in Python type conversion in Python refers to the process of converting a value?
be necessary when you need to perform operations on data that require it to be in a specific format or type some common?
first question question number 31 what?
is the difference between X range and range in functions this is also one of the most common questions asked in?
question number 32 what is the zip function zip function returns a zip object that Maps multiple containers?
number 33 what is Jango architecture one of the important p Via questions Jango?
is a highlevel web framework built in Python that allows rapid development of maintainable and secure websites its?
architecture consists of model where the data is managed and stored in the?
backend then template where the data is stored in the front end of the web page?
then view where functions accepts the web request and delivers the web?
responses next question number 34 what?
is inher itance and python you will frequently encounter this question in interviews inheritance allows a class to?
Python for example when you were duck typing and things appear like a duck it?
is regarded as a duck although it is merely a stamp or flag in this case the code has a runtime error another example?
is the print hacker IO that shows the runtime error due to the missing parentheses in?
what are doc strings in Python one of the most important question doc strings or documentation strings are multi-line?
describe what a function or method does although they are not comments doc strings sometimes serve the purpose of?
38 how can you capit capitalize the first letter of a string in Python in Python you can use the capitalize method?
what are generators in Python generators?
are most important python functions that return an iterable collection of items one at a time in an organized manner?
question number 40 how to write commands in Python it's very likely that you'll face this question in your interview so?
multi-line commands here's how a command?
is written in Python line one of command line two of command moving to question?
number 41 what is g g or the global interpreter lock is a mutex used to limit access to python objects it?
project requirements question number 43 what is flask explain its benefits flask?

have Simplicity and minimalism flask is easy to learn and use making it ideal for beginners and quick development of?
practices next question number 44 what?
is PIP you won't find this question in every interview but it's a regular feature in technical interviews to test?
python installer package which provides a seamless interface to install various python modules it is a command line tool?
number 45 how can you ensure that your python code is compatible with python 2 and Python 3 to write code that is?
question number 46 what is the difference between modulus operator division operator and floor division?
modulo operator which Returns the remainder of a division for instance five modulus 2 would return one the?
moving to question number 47 why doesn't python deallocate all memory upon exit whenever python exits especially those?
python modules which are having circular references to other objects or objects that are reference from the global name?
is a set known as unordered is it mutable or immutable make sure you have a solid understanding of this concept a?
Python are mutable which means you can add or remove items from a set after it's created however the items within?
are in the set moving to question number?
