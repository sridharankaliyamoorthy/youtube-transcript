# Contributing

Thanks for considering contributing! A few guidelines:

- Open an issue first to discuss bigger features.
- Keep changes small and focused; one PR per feature/fix.
- Add tests for new functionality and run the test suite.
- Follow existing code style. Use tools like `black` and `ruff` if desired.
- Write clear commit messages and include a descriptive PR title.
